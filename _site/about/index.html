  <h1>Healthy eating should be personal, not complicated</h1>

  <p class="about-lead">Nutriish was created for one simple reason: the best nutrition advice is the kind that actually fits your life, your family, and your schedule.</p>

  <div class="about-section">
    <h2>Why Nutriish exists</h2>
    <p>Most people know they should eat better. The problem is not knowledge, it is application. Generic meal plans, complicated apps, and expensive diet boxes do not account for the fact that you have a job, a family, a social life, and limited time to cook.</p>
    <p>Nutriish was built around a different idea: what if you had a nutrition expert available on your phone, ready to give you practical, personalized guidance that adapts to your real life? Not a program you follow, but a concierge you work with.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="about-values">
    <div class="about-value">
      <div class="about-value-icon">🎯</div>
      <h3>Personalized</h3>
      <p>Every meal plan is built around your preferences, schedule, and family needs. No two plans are the same.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="about-value">
      <div class="about-value-icon">💬</div>
      <h3>Simple</h3>
      <p>Everything happens on WhatsApp. No app to download, no dashboard to learn, just a conversation.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="about-value">
      <div class="about-value-icon">🌱</div>
      <h3>Sustainable</h3>
      <p>We focus on real food and lasting habits, not quick fixes, calorie counting, or restrictive diets.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="about-value">
      <div class="about-value-icon">🌍</div>
      <h3>Accessible</h3>
      <p>Available in English, French, and Spanish, for families and professionals around the world.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>How we work</h2>
    <p>When you join Nutriish, your concierge takes the time to understand your lifestyle, your food preferences, any dietary restrictions, and your goals. From there, you receive weekly meal plans, shopping lists, and practical tips adapted to what you already have at home.</p>
    <p>As your needs evolve, your plan evolves with you. It is not a program with a fixed end date, it is an ongoing relationship with someone who genuinely wants you to eat well.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="about-section">
    <h2>Who we serve</h2>
    <p>Nutriish works best for busy families who want to cook healthy meals without spending hours planning, and for professionals who want to fuel their day with real food without the guesswork. If you have ever felt overwhelmed by nutrition advice or frustrated by one-size-fits-all programs, Nutriish is for you.</p>
