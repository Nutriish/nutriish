  <title>How orangutans thrive in feast and famine without gaining weight</title>
  <meta name="description" content="Orangutans, humans’ close evolutionary relatives, have developed remarkable strategies to survive in the unpredictable rainforests of Borneo. A Rutgers-led study reveals that these apes balance protein intake and adjust their activity to match food availability, avoiding obesity and metabolic disease. Unlike humans, who often overeat processed foods without adjusting energy use, orangutans switch between fruits, leaves, and even stored body fat depending on the season. Their ability to maintain protein levels and conserve energy during scarcity offers insights not only into their survival but also into healthier dietary habits for people.">
