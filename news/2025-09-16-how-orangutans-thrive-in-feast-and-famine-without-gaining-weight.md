date: 2025-09-16
description: "Orangutans, humansâ€™ close evolutionary relatives, have developed remarkable strategies to survive in the unpredictable rainforests of Borneo.

Their ability to maintain protein levels and conserve energy during scarcity offers insights not only into their survival but also into healthier dietary habits for people."
