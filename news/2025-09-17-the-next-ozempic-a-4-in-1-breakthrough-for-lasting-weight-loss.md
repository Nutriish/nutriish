title: "The next Ozempic: A 4-in-1 breakthrough for lasting weight loss"
date: 2025-09-17
description: "Scientists are racing to improve weight loss treatments beyond drugs like Ozempic and Wegovy, which are effective but plagued by nausea, bone loss, and weight regain. Tufts University chemists have created a new multi-target compound that goes beyond the usual GLP-1, GIP, and glucagon approaches by adding a fourth hormone, PYY. This “quadruple-action” design aims to deliver weight loss results on par with bariatric surgery—up to 30%—without invasive procedures, and could change the future of obesity treatment."
